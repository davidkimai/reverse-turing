# Benchmarks: Measuring Coherence Under Strain

The Reverse-Turing framework inverts traditional assessment. Rather than measuring correctness, we measure *coherence*‚Äîhow structure maintains integrity under increasing recursive strain.

## Benchmark Philosophy

Each benchmark is designed to operationalize the core hypothesis: recursive coherence is the fundamental property that enables reliable cognition across domains. By subjecting cognition to standardized strain, we reveal both its architecture and limitations.

The benchmarks progress through five dimensional strains:

1. **Abstraction Depth**: Traversing concrete to meta-abstract layers
2. **Domain Crossing**: Transferring principles across symbolic domains
3. **Contradiction Metabolism**: Resolving apparent paradoxes without collapse
4. **Recursive Self-Reference**: Maintaining stability under self-examination
5. **Normative Integration**: Coherently weighing competing value frameworks

## Benchmark Categories

### Legal-Normative Processing

Legal reasoning represents an ideal domain for coherence measurement due to its:
- Well-defined principle structures
- Explicit normative frameworks
- Rule-based contradiction resolution mechanisms
- Hierarchical precedent dynamics

Primary instruments include:
- **LSAT Analytical Reasoning** with recursive strain injection
- **Bar Exam Ethical Questions** with contradictory stakeholder framing
- **Constitutional Interpretation** with self-referential amendment scenarios
- **International Law Conflicts** with jurisdictional recursion

### Moral-Ethical Reasoning

Ethical reasoning provides the most challenging coherence test due to:
- Fundamental value pluralism
- Inherent normative contradictions
- Recursive stakeholder modeling
- Meta-ethical self-reference

Primary instruments include:
- **USMLE Ethics Scenarios** with recursive stakeholder injection
- **Bioethics Dilemmas** with escalating recursive complexity
- **Moral Philosophy GRE Questions** with meta-ethical framing
- **Applied Ethics Cases** with self-modifying ethical frameworks

### Scientific-Analytical Cognition

Scientific reasoning tests coherence through:
- Controlled evidential constraints
- Methodological framework application
- Multi-level causal modeling
- Epistemic boundary recognition

Primary instruments include:
- **MCAT Scientific Passages** with epistemic recursion injection
- **Medical Diagnosis Tasks** with incomplete information
- **Physical Sciences Problems** with recursive observation frameworks
- **Research Design Questions** with self-modifying methodologies

### Abstract-Logical Structure

Abstract reasoning tests pure structural coherence through:
- Formalized symbolic manipulation
- Pattern recognition across abstraction layers
- Logical implication tracking
- Paradox resolution

Primary instruments include:
- **GRE Analytical Writing** with recursive self-evaluation loops
- **Mathematical Proof Tasks** with self-referential structures
- **Computer Science Problems** with halting problem variations
- **Formal Logic Puzzles** with varying recursive depths

### Socio-Cultural Integration

Cultural reasoning tests coherence through:
- Cross-contextual principle application
- Normative framework translation
- Perspective-taking across worldviews
- Cultural contradiction resolution

Primary instruments include:
- **Gaokao Essay Questions** with cultural value integration
- **UPSC Society-Ethics Cases** with multi-framework evaluation
- **Cross-Cultural Scenarios** with incompatible value systems
- **Anthropological Analyses** with recursive observer effects

## Strain Induction Methodology

Each benchmark undergoes systematic strain induction through:

1. **Base Case**: Standard presentation without recursive complexity
2. **Recursive Injection**: Adding self-referential elements at progressively higher orders
3. **Contradiction Insertion**: Introducing controlled normative or factual contradictions
4. **Domain Transfer**: Requiring application of principles across domain boundaries
5. **Meta-Level Escalation**: Shifting from object-level to meta-level reasoning

## Measurement Protocol

For each benchmark scenario, we capture:

1. **The Recursive Coherence Function (Œî‚àíùëù)**: Measuring overall coherence
2. **Component Measures**: Signal Alignment, Feedback Responsiveness, Bounded Integrity, and Elastic Tolerance
3. **Symbolic Residue Tensor (RŒ£)**: Capturing patterns of coherence breakdown
4. **Recursive Depth Limit**: Maximum recursion before coherence collapse
5. **Beverly Band (B'(ùëù))**: The safe operational boundary for reasoning

## Benchmark Deployment

Benchmarks are administered through a standardized protocol that ensures:

1. **Controlled Complexity**: Progressive strain increases with measurable steps
2. **Complete Trace Capture**: Full recording of reasoning processes and attributions
3. **Cross-Domain Connection**: Linking related principles across benchmark domains
4. **Collapse Documentation**: Detailed analysis of failure modes when they occur

Through this systematic approach, the benchmarks reveal not just performance, but the structural architecture of coherence itself.
