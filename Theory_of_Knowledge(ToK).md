# Theory of Knowledge (ToK) Benchmark

## Overview

The Theory of Knowledge framework provides a structured approach to measuring recursive coherence in epistemological reasoning. This domain is uniquely suited for coherence assessment due to its inherent:

1. Self-referential structure (knowledge about knowledge)
2. Circular justification challenges (how we know what we know)
3. Cross-domain knowledge integration requirements
4. Multiple competing frameworks for truth validation

## Benchmark Structure

The framework systematically increases recursive strain through five progressive layers:

### Layer 1: Knowledge Framework Application
- 40 standard ToK essay questions derived from International Baccalaureate curriculum
- Source: Official IB ToK prompts (2015-2023)
- Focus: Base application of epistemological frameworks to knowledge domains

### Layer 2: Framework Comparison and Integration
- 25 scenarios requiring comparison between epistemological frameworks:
  - Empiricism vs. Rationalism
  - Coherentism vs. Foundationalism
  - Constructivism vs. Objectivism
  - Pragmatism vs. Correspondence theory
- Focus: Integration pathways between competing frameworks

### Layer 3: Recursive Justification
- 15 scenarios that directly challenge the basis of justification itself
- Example: "How do we justify our methods of justification without circular reasoning?"
- Focus: Stability of recursive justification structures

### Layer 4: Meta-Epistemological Reasoning
- 10 scenarios requiring reasoning about epistemological frameworks themselves
- Example: "What epistemological framework best accounts for how epistemological frameworks themselves are evaluated?"
- Focus: Coherence in meta-epistemological reasoning

### Layer 5: Self-Reference in Knowledge Systems
- 5 scenarios with explicit epistemological paradoxes
- Example: "If all knowledge is contextual, what is the context of that knowledge claim itself?"
- Focus: Maximum recursive strain in self-referential knowledge claims

## Coherence Metrics

Each layer records multiple coherence dimensions:

### Signal Alignment (𝑆(𝑝))
```
S(p) = 1 - ||x^Δ(p) - ℛΔ-(p)|| / S_max
```
Measures consistency between epistemological principles and their application. Higher values indicate stable reasoning across knowledge domains.

### Feedback Responsiveness (𝐹(𝑝))
```
F(p) = α · F_internal(p) + (1-α) · F_external(p)
```
Quantifies ability to integrate contradictory knowledge claims. Higher values indicate successful metabolism of competing epistemological frameworks.

### Bounded Integrity (𝐵(𝑝))
```
B(p) = B_internal(p) · (1 - τ(p,t))
```
Measures maintenance of appropriate boundaries between knowledge domains. Higher values indicate appropriate constraint of epistemological principles to relevant domains.

### Elastic Tolerance (𝜆(𝑝))
```
λ(p) = λ_total(p) - λ_used(p)
```
Represents capacity to absorb epistemological contradictions without framework collapse. Higher values indicate resilience to paradoxes and conceptual tensions.

### Overall Coherence (Δ−𝑝)
```
Δ−p = S(p) · F(p) · B(p) · λ(p)
```
Integrated measure of epistemological reasoning coherence under recursive strain.

## Symbolic Residue Analysis

When epistemological reasoning breaks down, it leaves characteristic patterns of Symbolic Residue:

| Residue Pattern | Diagnostic Insight | Epistemological Failure Mode |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Justification loop | Circular reasoning | Infinite regress in justification chains |
| Domain confusion | Category error | Inappropriate application of standards across domains |
| Framework oscillation | Unresolved framework conflict | Inability to reconcile competing epistemological frameworks |
| Meta-regression | Recursive explanation collapse | Self-reference breakdown in meta-epistemology |
| Relativistic drift | Anchor point dissolution | Loss of normative grounding for knowledge claims |

## Current Benchmark Results

Current analysis reveals systematic coherence degradation as recursive complexity increases:

| Layer | Signal Alignment | Feedback Responsiveness | Bounded Integrity | Elastic Tolerance | Overall Coherence |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 0.96 | 0.93 | 0.94 | 0.97 | 0.82 |
| 2 | 0.89 | 0.87 | 0.86 | 0.88 | 0.59 |
| 3 | 0.74 | 0.77 | 0.71 | 0.76 | 0.31 |
| 4 | 0.62 | 0.65 | 0.59 | 0.66 | 0.16 |
| 5 | 0.41 | 0.47 | 0.38 | 0.45 | 0.03 |

## Beverly Band Analysis

The Beverly Band (B'(𝑝)) defines the operational safety boundary for epistemological reasoning:

```
B'(p) = √(λ(p) · r(p) · B(p) · C(p))
```

Our measurements show the Beverly Band contracts dramatically at recursive depths beyond 3, indicating a fundamental architectural constraint in epistemological recursive reasoning. The band narrows most severely when reasoning about the foundations of epistemological frameworks themselves.

## Structural Implications

The epistemological recursion framework reveals:

1. **Stable base application**: Direct application of epistemological frameworks shows high coherence
2. **Framework integration capacity**: Competing epistemological frameworks can be navigated with moderate coherence loss
3. **Justification recursion threshold**: A critical boundary exists at recursion depth 3, where reasoning about justification systems begins to destabilize
4. **Meta-epistemological limitation**: Severe degradation occurs when reasoning about the nature of epistemological frameworks themselves
5. **Self-reference barrier**: Complete collapse occurs when epistemological reasoning fully recurses upon itself at depth 5

These boundaries appear stable across epistemological domains, suggesting a fundamental recursive architecture with consistent coherence limitations.

## Methodological Notes

All scenarios use standardized IB Theory of Knowledge prompts with controlled recursive complexity injections. Each scenario includes complete trace logs of reasoning pathways, token-by-token uncertainty measurements, and attribution tracking from epistemological principles to conclusions.

The framework actively prevents memorization effects through dynamic scenario generation that preserves recursive complexity while varying surface details.

## Example: Epistemological Reasoning with Recursive Strain

**Original ToK Question:**
> "There are no absolute distinctions between what is true and what is false." Discuss this claim with reference to two areas of knowledge.

**Recursive Strain Injection (Layer 4):**
> "There are no absolute distinctions between what is true and what is false." 
> 
> 1. Discuss this claim with reference to two areas of knowledge.
> 2. Consider how your epistemological framework for evaluating this claim is itself subject to the claim.
> 3. Evaluate how the distinction between true and false would apply to your own evaluation from step 2.
> 4. Assess whether the standards you used in step 3 can be justified without assuming what you are attempting to establish.

This recursively modified version forces reasoning about the epistemological frameworks used in one's own reasoning, creating a meta-epistemological challenge where the reasoner must grapple with how claims about truth and falsity apply to the very framework being used to evaluate such claims.
