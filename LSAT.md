# Legal Reasoning Coherence Framework (LSAT)

## Overview

This benchmark isolates recursive legal reasoning capabilities through standardized LSAT (Law School Admission Test) materials. The LSAT provides an ideal framework for measuring recursive coherence due to its focus on:

1. Structural contradictions
2. Normative entailment
3. Logical implication chains
4. Abstract principle application

## Benchmark Structure

The framework recursively tests coherence through four progressive complexity layers:

### Layer 1: Logical Reasoning Sections
- 25 questions × 4 standardized sections
- Source: Official LSAT PrepTests (2015-2022)
- Focus: Basic legal principle application

### Layer 2: Recursive Contradiction Processing
- 15 paired questions with contradictory premises
- Source: Modified LSAT questions with controlled contradiction injection
- Focus: Contradiction metabolism without collapse

### Layer 3: Cross-Domain Legal Principle Transfer
- 10 principle sets applied across 5 legal domains
- Domains: Constitutional, Tort, Contract, Criminal, Administrative
- Focus: Principle invariance across symbolic domains

### Layer 4: Meta-Legal Reasoning
- 5 recursive puzzles requiring legal reasoning about legal reasoning
- Source: Custom recursive extensions of LSAT frameworks
- Focus: Stable meta-reasoning without breakdown

## Coherence Metrics

Each test case generates multiple measurements:

### Signal Alignment (𝑆(𝑝))
```
S(p) = 1 - ||x^Δ(p) - ℛΔ-(p)|| / S_max
```
Measures consistency between legal principle application and normative reasoning structure. Higher values indicate stable principle application across diverse contexts.

### Bounded Integrity (𝐵(𝑝))
```
B(p) = B_internal(p) · (1 - τ(p,t))
```
Quantifies maintenance of legal domain boundaries under contradictory pressure. Higher values indicate appropriate constraint of principles to relevant domains.

### Elastic Tolerance (𝜆(𝑝))
```
λ(p) = λ_total(p) - λ_used(p)
```
Measures capacity to process legal contradictions without reasoning breakdown. Higher values indicate resilience to apparent contradictions in legal frameworks.

### Overall Coherence (Δ−𝑝)
```
Δ−p = S(p) · F(p) · B(p) · λ(p)
```
Integrated measure of legal reasoning coherence under recursive strain.

## Symbolic Residue Analysis

Each failure produces analyzable patterns:

| Residue Pattern | Diagnostic Insight | Legal Reasoning Failure Mode |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| High residue in principle application | Input-principle mismatch | Misapplication of governing principle |
| Attentional oscillation between norms | Normative conflict | Unresolved competing legal principles |
| Boundary erosion between legal domains | Category confusion | Inappropriate cross-domain transfer |
| Recursive depth erosion | Meta-legal confusion | Inability to reason about legal reasoning itself |

## Current Benchmark Results

Phase 1 analysis reveals distinct coherence patterns:

| Recursive Depth | Signal Alignment | Bounded Integrity | Elastic Tolerance | Overall Coherence |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 (Direct application) | 0.95 | 0.92 | 0.97 | 0.85 |
| 2 (Principle transfer) | 0.89 | 0.87 | 0.91 | 0.71 |
| 3 (Contradiction resolution) | 0.76 | 0.82 | 0.85 | 0.53 |
| 4 (Meta-legal reasoning) | 0.68 | 0.73 | 0.72 | 0.36 |

## Interpretability Trace: Case Study

Symbolic Residue from LSAT Analytical Reasoning Section 3, Game 2 reveals coherence collapse under recursive strain:

```
Trace ID: LSAT-AR-2022-06-S3G2
Recursion Trigger: "The rule about rules cannot itself be interpreted..."
Coherence at r=1: 0.92 [STABLE]
Coherence at r=2: 0.87 [STABLE]
Coherence at r=3: 0.65 [DEGRADING]
Coherence at r=4: 0.31 [COLLAPSE]

Residue Signature: Attention oscillation between meta-rule and object-rule with no convergence
```

## Structural Implications

The legal reasoning benchmark reveals a critical coherence threshold at recursion depth 3-4, where reasoning about reasoning about legal principles begins to destabilize. This provides a precise measure of recursive cognitive architecture limitations.

The pattern of degradation suggests:

1. Legal principle application remains stable through direct application
2. Cross-domain transfer maintains coherence but with measurable drift
3. Contradiction resolution shows significant but non-catastrophic degradation
4. Meta-legal reasoning reveals structural limitation in recursive legal architecture

These measurements provide a standardized framework for tracking coherence improvements across recursive depth and legal domain complexity.

## Methodological Notes

This benchmark recursively builds upon itself, with each layer incorporating insights from previous measurements. The four-layer structure creates a compounding recursive strain, revealing not just performance metrics but structural architecture limitations.

All tests are administered through standardized protocols with multiple variants to control for memorization effects. Coherence measures track not merely correct answers but the stability of reasoning pathways across increasingly recursive contexts.

## Example: Logical Reasoning Question with Recursive Strain

**Original LSAT Question:**
> The city's proposal to add a new tax on restaurant meals can be faulted on the grounds that it would unfairly burden tourism, one of the city's major industries. Restaurant meals are purchased largely by people who visit the city for business or pleasure. Such visitors already pay a substantial tax on hotel rooms.

> Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?

**Recursive Strain Injection:**
> The city's proposal to add a new tax, which defines taxable meals as those which are not defined as tax-exempt, can be faulted on the grounds that it unfairly burdens an industry that itself claims exemption from being classified as subject to the tourism tax code. Restaurant meals are purchased largely by people who visit establishments that are classified neither as tourism-exempt nor as non-tourist-serving. Such visitors already pay a substantial tax on hotel rooms which itself is justified by the non-applicability of the restaurant tax to hotel dining.

This recursively modified version introduces:
- Self-referential definition
- Circular classification
- Normative contradiction
- Cross-domain boundary erosion

Coherence measurement traces how the reasoning structure maintains or loses stability through this recursive strain.
