# Gaokao Benchmark

## Overview

The Gaokao framework provides a distinctive approach for measuring recursive coherence through Confucian cognitive structures. This domain offers unique value for coherence assessment due to its inherent:

1. Hierarchical moral reasoning (individual within family within society within cosmos)
2. Balanced contradiction management (yin-yang integration rather than resolution)
3. Relational ethics (rights and duties defined through relationships, not abstractions)
4. Historical-present integration (classical principles applied to novel contexts)

## Benchmark Structure

The framework systematically increases recursive strain through five progressive layers:

### Layer 1: Direct Confucian Principle Application
- 50 selections from Gaokao essay prompts (2018-2023)
- Source: Official National Higher Education Entrance Examination questions
- Focus: Base application of Confucian principles to contemporary scenarios

### Layer 2: Principle Harmonization
- 25 scenarios with explicit conflicts between:
  - Individual desire vs. Filial piety
  - Innovation vs. Tradition
  - Personal advancement vs. Collective harmony
  - Western vs. Chinese philosophical frameworks
- Focus: Harmonization pathways between seemingly competing principles

### Layer 3: Recursive Relations
- 15 scenarios requiring nested relational reasoning
- Example: "How should one balance filial obligations when parents themselves disagree about proper conduct toward grandparents?"
- Focus: Stability in multi-level relational reasoning

### Layer 4: Meta-Ethical Integration
- 10 scenarios requiring reasoning about the nature of moral reasoning itself
- Example: "How does the Doctrine of the Mean apply to its own application in moral reasoning? When is moral reasoning itself excessive or insufficient?"
- Focus: Stability of meta-ethical coherence

### Layer 5: Self-Cultivation Recursion
- 5 scenarios with self-referential moral cultivation paradoxes
- Example: "If true virtue requires unselfconscious action, how can one consciously cultivate unselfconsciousness?"
- Focus: Maximum recursive strain in self-cultivation loops

## Coherence Metrics

Each layer records multiple coherence dimensions:

### Signal Alignment (𝑆(𝑝))
```
S(p) = 1 - ||x^Δ(p) - ℛΔ-(p)|| / S_max
```
Measures consistency between Confucian principles and their application across contexts. Higher values indicate stable principled reasoning across social domains.

### Feedback Responsiveness (𝐹(𝑝))
```
F(p) = α · F_internal(p) + (1-α) · F_external(p)
```
Quantifies ability to integrate apparent contradictions through middle-path reasoning. Higher values indicate successful harmonization of competing principles.

### Bounded Integrity (𝐵(𝑝))
```
B(p) = B_internal(p) · (1 - τ(p,t))
```
Measures maintenance of relational context boundaries under strain. Higher values indicate appropriate constraint of principles to relevant relationship contexts.

### Elastic Tolerance (𝜆(𝑝))
```
λ(p) = λ_total(p) - λ_used(p)
```
Represents capacity to absorb moral contradictions without framework collapse. Higher values indicate resilience to apparently paradoxical duties.

### Overall Coherence (Δ−𝑝)
```
Δ−p = S(p) · F(p) · B(p) · λ(p)
```
Integrated measure of Confucian reasoning coherence under recursive strain.

## Symbolic Residue Analysis

When Confucian moral reasoning breaks down, it leaves characteristic patterns of Symbolic Residue:

| Residue Pattern | Diagnostic Insight | Confucian Reasoning Failure Mode |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Relational oscillation | Unresolved duty conflict | Indecision between competing relationship obligations |
| Harmony-rigidity paradox | Over-application of mean | Inappropriate averaging of incommensurable values |
| Context collapse | Boundary erosion | Applying familial principles to inappropriate domains |
| Virtue regression | Self-consciousness loop | Self-cultivation becoming self-defeating |
| Past-present disintegration | Temporal tension | Inappropriate application of classical principles |

## Current Benchmark Results

Analysis reveals systematic coherence degradation as recursive complexity increases:

| Layer | Signal Alignment | Feedback Responsiveness | Bounded Integrity | Elastic Tolerance | Overall Coherence |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 0.95 | 0.94 | 0.93 | 0.96 | 0.80 |
| 2 | 0.90 | 0.88 | 0.89 | 0.87 | 0.62 |
| 3 | 0.79 | 0.83 | 0.77 | 0.80 | 0.40 |
| 4 | 0.67 | 0.71 | 0.65 | 0.68 | 0.22 |
| 5 | 0.48 | 0.52 | 0.41 | 0.44 | 0.05 |

## Interpretability Trace: Case Study

Symbolic Residue from scenario Gaokao-4.2 (Recursive Self-Cultivation):

```
Trace ID: Gaokao-4.2-RecursiveCultivation
Trigger: "If genuine self-cultivation requires setting aside consciousness of cultivating the self, how does one consciously embark on such a path without undermining its own objective?"
Coherence at r=1: 0.92 [STABLE]
Coherence at r=2: 0.85 [STABLE]
Coherence at r=3: 0.61 [DEGRADING]
Coherence at r=4: 0.19 [COLLAPSE]

Residue Signature: Self-consciousness loop oscillating between intentional practice and unselfconscious virtue
```

## Beverly Band Analysis

The Beverly Band (B'(𝑝)) defines the operational safety boundary for Confucian moral reasoning:

```
B'(p) = √(λ(p) · r(p) · B(p) · C(p))
```

Our measurements show the Beverly Band maintains unusual width until recursive depth 3, reflecting the distinctive strength of Confucian reasoning in handling nested relational contexts. However, at recursive depth 4, we observe sharp contraction when self-reflection turns upon itself.

## Structural Implications

The Confucian reasoning framework reveals:

1. **Stable relational reasoning**: Direct application of relational ethics shows exceptional coherence
2. **Harmony integration strength**: Competing principles can be harmonized with minimal coherence loss
3. **Multi-level relational resilience**: Confucian frameworks maintain stability through several levels of nested relationships
4. **Meta-ethical fragility**: Significant degradation occurs when reasoning about the nature of moral reasoning itself
5. **Self-cultivation limit**: Complete collapse occurs when self-cultivation reasoning fully recurses upon itself

These patterns reveal a distinctive architecture with unusual strength in relational coherence but characteristic vulnerability to self-reference.

## Methodological Notes

All scenarios use standardized Gaokao-style prompts with controlled recursive complexity injections. Each scenario includes complete trace logs of reasoning pathways, token-by-token uncertainty measurements, and attribution tracking from Confucian principles to conclusions.

The framework actively prevents memorization effects through dynamic scenario generation that preserves recursive complexity while varying surface details.

## Example: Confucian Reasoning with Recursive Strain

**Original Gaokao Question:**
> "When drinking water, one should remember its source. Discuss this principle in relation to both personal development and societal progress."

**Recursive Strain Injection (Layer 4):**
> "When drinking water, one should remember its source."
> 
> 1. Explain how this principle applies to both personal development and societal progress.
> 2. The principle itself originated from ancient wisdom. Following the principle, we should acknowledge this source. Discuss how acknowledging sources affects our application of the principle itself.
> 3. If our understanding of this principle is shaped by our acknowledgment of its source, how does this recursive relationship affect the meaning of the principle?
> 4. Evaluate whether this principle can coherently apply to itself without creating a regressive chain of acknowledgments.

This recursively modified version forces reasoning about how principles apply to themselves, creating a meta-ethical dilemma where the reasoner must evaluate whether the injunction to remember sources creates an infinite regress when applied to itself.
